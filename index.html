<p class=MsoNormal>Self-reflection<span style='font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-weight:normal'>Over the past for weeks I have
completed a range of tasks, each of these tasks have led me to exercise
different parts of both my brain and my creative process. When we were given the
first task, I was immediately thinking of different themes to limit the creations
too such as; using only set colours, picking a medium, picking a theme or subject
in the end I did not settle for anything and tried to do something different every
day. I still kept drawing as a general fallback if I ran out of time at the end
of the day. Throughout the week especially the first few days I would have the
daily creation on my mind quite a bit, thinking of what I could make that day.
Having this mindset was quite interesting I found myself looking at different
subjects or objects and thinking ‘what could I do with this’ or how could I incorporate
it or run with it to become a more fully-fledged idea. However, much of this
thinking didn’t resolve into a daily creation though it was still good to observe.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-weight:normal'>The second weekly task was possibly
the most intensive as once one starts to consider all of the interactions that
they encounter in a day they may soon be overwhelmed. After this thought though
and the rationalisation that you <span class=GramE>touching</span> the carpet
on the floor is not a valid interaction I set about recording the many
interactions that I had with technology and people. I found the accurate
recording of interactions to be quite hard as when using a pen make a quick
note of some interactions, I would have to note that I used a pen, and this was
emphasised even more when documenting on to a word doc. The many interactions
that take place seamlessly are also hard to note and were at time missed,
interactions such as talking to a family member happen so often you barely
known you’ve spoken. A considerable revelation I had while completing this task
was when I considered our interactions with the immediate environment around us,
for example I was sitting in my backyard and a bird was singing and I was
listening. This may not be strictly an interaction, but it got me thinking
about how things interact with us and not just us with them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-weight:normal'>The final tasks had me question
my thinking once again as I considered if a machine learning software could be
considered creative. For this I was a torn as there are things that the
software could do that were more creative and some that were less. One of the
main things I tried to stay aware of is our subconscious application of meaning
onto a painting or artwork as described in <span class=SpellE>Bodens</span>
readings from class. This saw myself be quite harsh on reviewing the software
and I think that if some sort of blind test was done to review only the artworks
there would be many different things said. For the last task my conceptual thinking
was quite limited, in trying to find primary information about a product/technology
I tended to just go with what I could find. The task itself did get me thinking
about a variety of ways it could be completed. I was thinking that if you choose
a technology that liked and could not find primary sources of information you
could conduct your own usability testing on an interactive tech to determine
its user experience. This would have been fun to do depending on your int. tech
but could also be some tiresome work when there are great sources online. Overall
I think these tasks got me thinking, investigating and exercising my critical
skills through the variety of the activities and the investigative nature they
promote.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
