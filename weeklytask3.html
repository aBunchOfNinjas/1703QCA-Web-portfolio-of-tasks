<p class=MsoNormal>The painting fool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The painting fool by Simon Colton is a software that uses a
variety of techniques to imitate the human painting and creating process and
produce novel paintings that have a degree of conceptual depth. The aim of the
project is to have the painting fool be seen as a creative artist [1]
however this may take some time. To achieve this and have the painting software
be considered creative the creator believes that the software must exhibit behaviours
of skilfulness, appreciation&nbsp;and&nbsp;imagination. The creator also
refrences these points in explaning how it works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first itereations of the software focused on the fuction
of replicating a painting style and applying it to a source image, this was successful
but very far from creative. Refereing back to the creators criteria he discribes
the different techneques that the software uses to be skillful, these are based
from three main processes. First the software determines areas of colour, then this
can be made abstract or change its colour to a palette (presumably it has been
taugh some colour theory). The software can then simulate a variety of media
and techneques for using said media and this can include painting, pastel and
pencil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a way this could be compared to a well practised human painter
trying to copy a photograph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The appreciation aspects that the software shows are graphed
from human emotions. The software has been taugh different emotive painting
styles to help it show emotion in its work but it also uses computer vision to
read emotion from source images e.g a face in a portrait. Other techneques used
to conceptulise emotion in a work include using sentiment analysis to extract
keywords from a piece of text. These words are then searched against an image search
engine such as google to produce themed source images for the system to work
from. An example were the system red a newspaper article about the afganistan war
and extracted </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=120 height=120
src="task%203%20and%204.fld/image001.png" align=left hspace=12
alt="A plate of food on a table&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated">keywords
such as ‘nato’ and ‘troops’ produced and interesting         Figure 1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>result but in all it seems to share likeness to a collage (see
fig1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The idea of the software having an imagination is quite
hopeful but in actuality I myself don’t belive it as genuine. To invent new imagery
the software can use generative AI techneques to create scenes with repeated
paterns or abstract works but, these all start from some sort of algarithim. To
create objects the software can use 3D modelling tools and has done so to
create a chair, however the basis of this invention is unclear. A final tool
that the system uses is the <i>contextfree</i> software which uses algorithims
and random variation to produce novel figures and images.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the software is skillful, shows some appreciation and is inventive
but is it creative well some ways I could be considered creative is in its ability
to create novel artworks. Now the immediate though is that its ideas aren’t
novel because they all start from some sort of source but, all creatives that
are coming up with ideas are drawing them from somewhere in there life
experience, its just that this software can only pick from a few things. Other
considerations include its ability to follow Bodens forms of creativity to a
degree, there is definatly evidence of combinational creativity even from the
softwares conception it showed some signs but also transformational creativity
with work like the afagahn war piece and a more recent piece ‘<a
href="http://www.thepaintingfool.com/galleries/no_photos_harmed/index.html">No
photos harmed</a>’  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my belief the software shows so very rudimentory signs of
creativity. The main problem I have with calling it creative is its methods of
generating novel ideas, all of the methods discibed were rooted in a humans
programing of an algorithim or the combination of ideas from anothers work.
Looking back to the image about the afganistan war; the system finds key words,
then images that are equivelent to thoughs words and overlays its drawing
imitaion to produce a highly stylised collage. Some of the images in the
drawing could be seen as provocative but is this just luck of what image
results google produced. The software dosen’t really known the meaning of what
it has drawn so is it still of conceptual value. I belive that it is not, to me
the result of the software is the product of a series of processes performed on
data and the conceptual value that the image infures is from the nature of the material(the
newspaper) given to the system by its creator. </p>
